    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        I am an undergraduate student currently in the third year of
        a four-year B.Sc. degree in <i>Software engineering</i> at Bauman Moscow
        State Technical University (<a href="http://iu7.bmstu.ru/">IU7</a>).
        I am interested in systems programming: operating systems, databases,
        device drivers, compilers.
        I am currently working at Huawei Research and development department in
        Database Intelligence and Optimization center laboratory.
    </p>

    <h1>Educaction</h1>
    <p>
        Software engineering B.Sc. BMSTU, expected 2025
    </p>
    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>
        I am most proficient in developing operating systems and
        compilers. I am passionate about discrete maths, functional programming,
        low-level optimizations and systems architecture.
        In my work and and personal endeavors I have worked with
        following technologies:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>C/C++ compiler development and static analysis</li>
        <li>Linux device drivers</li>
        <li>Television: Teletext subtitles rolling</li>
        <li>Database managment systems development: PostgreSQL, SQLite</li>
        <li>Functional programming languages: Haskell, Scala, Elm, Scheme</li>
        <li>Microcontroller programming: Rust, C, stm32, Raspberry Pi Pico</li>
        <li>Computer graphics: OpenGL, Vulkan, Game engines</li>
        <li>Assembly SIMD programming</li>
    </ul>

    my studies in University: <a href="https://github.com/Holodome/BMSTU">link</a>.

    <h1>Personal projects</h1>
    <h2>moOSe</h2>
    <p>
        Ambitious project to write operating system completely from 
        scratch. It is an operating system similar to UNIX for amd64. 
        It includes a multitasking kernel, virtual file system, 
        support for multiple native file systems, driver system, 
        internet and its own bootloader.
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/Holodome/moose">repo</a></p>
    <h2>hololisp</h2>
    <p>
        A project to write an interpreter for a dialect of LISP in C.
        Implemented a virtual machine with bytecode pre-compilation,
        garbage collector, tail recursion optimization and macro system.
        The frontend is powered by WebAssembly.

    <h2>lcd-clock-rs</h2>
    <p>
        Firmward for Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller used
        with <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/lcd-clock-a.htm">hardware kit</a>.
        This is a retro-styled clock with 6 TFT LCD's, several buttons and ambient LED's.
        When I have bought clock kit official resources lacked firmware for it, so I had
        decided to write my own. It turned out to be quite fun little project.
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/Holodome/lcd-clock-rs">repo</a></p>
    <h2>Ray</h2>
    <p>School ray tracer project. Although it does not try hard to be original,
        as it is mostly based on awesome
        <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">ray tracing in one weekend book
            series</a>,
        I think the code is well-structured in procedural C style. This is small
        application that does not try hard to be well-designed and thus is very simple
        and straightfoward to read.

    <h1>Books that I did read</h1>
    <p>Some people ask me what books did I read. I have decided to make this list
       here both to remind myself and to answer these questions.</p>
    <p>Altough large portion of infromation comes from articles, papers, and other 
       resources, I do not consider these resources worth mentioning in this list
       due to their narrow technical speciality. However there will be some notable mentions.</p>
    <p>I did not read all of the books mentioned here from start to finish.
       I also neither remember nor understand absolutely everything written.
       Particularry, PBRT is highly-specific, but I had a great pleasure 
       going through it, despite understanding very little.</p>
