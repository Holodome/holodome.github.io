    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        I am an undergraduate student currently in the third year of
        a four-year B.Sc. degree in <i>Software engineering</i> at Bauman Moscow
        State Technical University (<a href="http://iu7.bmstu.ru/">IU7</a>).
        I am interested in operating systems, DBMS's and compilers.
        I am currently working at Huawei Research and Development department in
        Database Intelligence and Optimization center laboratory.

    <h1>Personal projects</h1>
    <h2>csbench</h2>
    <p>
        Command-line benchmarking tool. It can be used to evaluated 
        and compare performance of any shell command with additional 
        statistical analyis. Furthermore, csbench allows extracting
        arbitrary data from command output, allowing analysing not only
        command execution time, but also custom data.

    <h2>moOSe</h2>
    <p>
        Ambitious project to write operating system completely from
        scratch. It is an operating system similar to UNIX for amd64.
        It includes a multitasking kernel, virtual file system,
        support for multiple native file systems, driver system,
        internet and its own bootloader.

    <h2>hololisp</h2>
    <p>
        A project to write an interpreter for a dialect of LISP in C.
        Implemented a virtual machine with bytecode pre-compilation,
        garbage collector, tail recursion optimization and macro system.
        The frontend is powered by WebAssembly.

    <h2>voxel-water</h2>
    <p>
        Real time ray tracing with water simulation. Cross-platform, compiles to
        webassembly.

    <h2>lcd-clock-rs</h2>
    <p>
        Firmward for Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller used
        with <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/lcd-clock-a.htm">hardware kit</a>.
        This is a retro-styled clock with 6 TFT LCD's, several buttons and ambient LED's.
        When I have bought clock kit official resources lacked firmware for it, so I had
        decided to write my own. It turned out to be quite fun little project.

    <h2>Ray</h2>
    <p>School ray tracer project. Although it does not try hard to be original,
        as it is mostly based on awesome
        <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">ray tracing in one weekend book
            series</a>,
        I think the code is well-structured in procedural C style. This is small
        application that does not try hard to be well-designed and thus is very simple
        and straightfoward to read.
